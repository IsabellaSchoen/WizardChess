As this project was just an excercise for Software Engineering at HTWG Konstanz,
there isn't much sense in committing. Of course, if you wan't to, feel free to play around with this project.

If you want to add something we probably won't accept pull requests until march, because our project still
has to be evaluated.

Later on this project is completely availlable for everyone to use and to contribute to.
