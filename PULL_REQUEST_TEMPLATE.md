Pull requests won't be accepted until around march, for further information read the other information files.

All in all contributing to this product at all might not be a that great idea, because this project is just a school-project
and will probably not be developed anymore after evaluation.

@IsabellaSchoen and @LeonBudimovic are the developers of WizardChess, so pull requests (if these are after evaluation) will be
reviewed by the developers.
