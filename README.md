## WizardChess
Welcome to our project for Software Engineering. In this project we are programming our game called "WizardChess". If you are a Harry Potter fan you may have heard about this Chess. It was part of the first movie. But how excately you can define WizardChess? This is very simple: 
Wizard = Harry Potter 
Harry Potte + Chess = Normal chess with figures of Harry Potter's Chess
