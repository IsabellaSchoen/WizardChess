Welcome to WizardChess!

You don't know the rules? That's no problem, here are the basics:

Colour:
Depending on your colour, white is allowed to start.

Figures:
- pawn: The pawn is allowed to go only straight forward! You can choose, at the beginning you can go two steps and then only one step.
	Or you only go one step forward.
- rook: The rook can only go straigt forward or to the left or right. How many steps depends on you ;)
- horse: The horse is a bit more difficult. You have think three steps, here all the options:
		1) one straight and two left/right
		2) two straigt and one left/right
- bishop: The bishop is more easy. Here you have to think now in a diagonal way. Many steps as you want.
- queen: The queen is the most powerful figure in the whole game and actually the funniest as well. Her rule is the mixture out of
	 of the rook and bishop. If you don't remeber, check out their rules. Here as well: many steps as you want.
- king: When you think about the king the first thing that comes to your mind, he is powerful....wrong - sorry.
	He is not at all. He is the most sensitive figure and you have to protect him the whole game! If your king gets hit, you lose.
	You only can go to the right, left, forward and back - only one step.


Oh aaaaand..... with every figure (except the pawns) you always can go back ;)



Enjoy your game :D
